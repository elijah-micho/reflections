1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1) Git makes the directory into a repository so now it can track the history of the directory so that
we can now commit the files.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A2) The staging area is that contains the files to be commited to the repository. The working directory
contains all the files in the directory but the staging area dies nit necessarily.
