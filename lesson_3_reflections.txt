1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1) When you are working on a project from different locations/computers or working with
other people contributing.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2) You might not want certain branches in the chain and if git automatically pulled
those commits you'll end up with lots of info you don't need or want.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
A3) Fork: cloning a repository but only to and from GitHub server. Clone: create a 
copy of a git repository whether local or on GitHub. Branches: create different
line for certain commits. Use depending on context.
