1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1) When you are working on a project from different locations/computers or working with
other people contributing.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2) You might not want certain branches in the chain and if git automatically pulled
those commits you'll end up with lots of info you don't need or want.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
A3) Fork: cloning a repository but only to and from GitHub server. Clone: create a 
copy of a git repository whether local or on GitHub. Branches: create different
line for certain commits. Use depending on context.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A4) So that you are up to date with the latest from the time you fetched the remote.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A5) Share through dropbox, google drive, email or other sharing services. Most of these services 
provide automatic saving but everything else would be harder.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
A6) When you're working on a different feature or something not ready to be put into
the main master branch. Working in a seperate branch allows you freedom to try new things
without impacting the project. Working in master makes it easier for you to have your
changes be implemented in the main project.
